Synopsis
--------

| *git review*

Description
-----------

This command is executed on a branch created via **git-start(1)**. All
outstanding commits are pushed to the remote branch and a pull request is
created in GitHub for the issue/story. Both the JIRA and Pivotal Tracker
configurations support templates for structuring the pull request title and
description. You may continue to commit and push branch changes based on
review feedback.
