continuity: Continuous dev flow through Pivotal Tracker and GitHub.

Inspired by GitHub Flow (http://j.mp/github-flow)


The Concept
===========

This is a re-summarization of GitHub Flow:
- Anything in the 'master' branch is deployable.
- All new work is created with a 'story' branch off of 'master' (or an
  integration branch).
- In process work is regularly committed locally and pushed to a remote 'story'
  branch.
- When the 'story' branch is ready for review, open a pull request.
- Once the 'story' branch is reviewed, merge it into 'master' (or an
  integration branch).
- Ideally, 'master' will be deployed as soon as a 'story' is merged and pushed.

The first and last of these points are informed primarily by The Lean Startup
Movement. If you haven't already, buy and read the book by Eric Ries
(http://theleanstartup.com). Seriously, do that now. Then come back here when
you're inspired to continuously build-measure-learn.

The middle four points are covered by continuity. Once a git repository is
configured for continuity; story management, branching, pull request review, and
merging are a breeze. And it's all handled at the command line using custom git
commands. So you're not bouncing around between pivotaltracker.com, github.com,
and your code in order to get things done. Stay in the zone!


The Installation
================

Simple with pip:

$ pip install continuity

To configure a repository for continuity, run the following command:

$ continuity init


The Interface
=============

init
    Initialize a git repository for use with continuity.

start (aliased by init as git-start)
    Start a branch linked to a Pivotal Tracker story.

story (aliased by init as git-story)
    Display story branch information.

tasks (aliased by init as git-tasks)
    List and manage story tasks.

review (aliased by init as git-review)
    Open a GitHub pull request for story branch review.

finish (aliased by init as git-finish)
    Finish a story branch.
